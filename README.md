To achieve Highly Availability and Scalability
- 
Scale out - Scale in Policies:

Scale up:
Adding more hardware to a server to make it bigger in order to increase its load. This is done by:
    - buying more RAM
    - buying a bigger processor
    - buying a bigger disk or network cards

Scale out :
Scale out would be to spread the workload over mutiple machines, as shown in the image above. 

## Network Monitoring

- Network Monitoring:
Network monitoring is constantly using systems to monitor a computer network for slow or failing components. The system is configure such thatit notifies the network administrator in case of outages or other trouble.



## Resource Monitoring

Resource Monitoring can provide a comprehensive view of a system under test, to help determining problems. 



## Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
The goal of an APM is to  performance monitoring works by: Observing whether your apps are behaving normally.If not, the somone will be alerted. 




## SNS A2A vs  A2P vs  SQS?

### Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) is a notification service. It provides a low-cost infrastructure for the mass delivery of infomration via text, email etc.. 




## A2A
### This section provides information about using Amazon SNS for application-to-application messaging with subscribers.

Resource Monitoring (CPU, Network< Memory etc)

Network Monitoring:

- Application Performance Monitoring
- Any Third-party resources/component

- create or use metrics and Graphs create a Dash board of key service health
create logs of events

what is the diff between Scaling out and Scaling :
- SNS A2A
    - 
- SNS A2P
    - 
- SQS?
    - 
Create a Diagram for each service and the entire process of making your App highly available and scalable
